            <h2>Difference between ClassFull and CIDR </h2>
			<article> 
			
            <p class = "text">IANA, or the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority, is responsible for allocating the entire IP address space to any entity that needs a presence on the Internet (0.0.0.0 – 255.255.255.255).
IANA has delegated this responsibility to five Regional Internet Registries (RIRs): ARIN, RIPE, LACNIC, AFRINIC, APNIC, 
which in turn allocate address space to the various corporations in their regions.</p>
			<h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;"> What is ClassFull ? </h1>
			<p class="text">Classful addressing is how the early Internet was formed. IP assignments were given on the Octet boundaries: </p>
 
 <p class="text"> The idea behind Classful address assignments was, if you were a company that …

<p class="text">… needed 200 IP addresses, a /24 IP address block from the Class C range would be assigned.</p>
<p class="text">… needed 50,000 IP addresses, a /16 IP address block from the Class B range would be assigned.</p>
<p class="text">… needed over 65,000~ IP addresses, a /8 IP address block from the Class A range would be assigned.</p>
<p class="text">However, this led to a lot of wasted IP addresses. If, for instance, you only needed 300 IP addresses, a Class C would not suffice, so you would end up with a Class B and nearly 60,000 IP addresses would be wasted.

You could argue, why not simply assign two /24 blocks from the Class C range (providing 512 IP addresses)? Good point, and this frequently was done. But what if you needed 25,000 IP addresses? That would require 98 different /24 blocks from the Class C range.
 Instead, a single Class B was assigned — which still meant about 40,000 IP addresses were wasted.</p>
			
<h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;"> What is Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) ? </h1>
<p class="text">With Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR), IP assignments are not limited to the three classes. The whole unicast range (any IP address with a first octet of 0 – 223) can be allocated in any size block. In effect, the whole concept of IP address classes is done away with entirely.

Instead of requiring the IP assignment from the RIRs to be either a 255.0.0.0 or 255.255.0.0 or 255.255.255.0 block, 
they could be any size — and for simplicity, slash notation was adopted. </p>

<p class="text"> If you need 300 IP addresses … You get a /23.</p>
<p class="text">If you need 500 IP addresses … You also get a /23. </p>
<p class="text">If you need 1000 IP addresses … You get a /22.
 </p>
<p class="text"> If you need 250,000 IP addresses …
 You get a /14 (instead of the ~16 million IP addresses from the /8 block that would have been assigned in the Classful world).</p>
<p class="text">This creates a system in which IP address ranges are assigned with a much, much smaller rate of wasted IP addresses. </p>
<p class="text"> The rare exception, however, is certain archaic protocols or devices which operate “classfully”. This means they assume a mask based upon the IP address, according to the IP address’s class. For example, if a classful protocol or device is given the IP address 199.22.33.4 — 
the first octet is 199, which means this is a Class C address, and the Subnet Mask is assumed to be 255.255.255.0.</p>

<h1 style="color:#FF1E90;"> Summary </h1>
<p class="text"> Classful addressing is IANA/RIRs assigning IP space from Class A, B, or C blocks (legacy).</p>
<p class="text">Classless or CIDR is IANA/RIRs assigning IP space in any size block, as required (modern standard). </p>
<p class="text"> </p>
