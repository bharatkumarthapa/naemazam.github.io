            <h2>What Is Subnet and Subnet mask? How it Works ?  </h2>
			<article> 
			<h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;"> What is Subnet ? </h1>
            <p class = "text">A subnet, or subnetwork, is a network inside a network. Subnets make networks more efficient. Through subnetting,
			network traffic can travel a shorter distance without passing through unnecessary routers to reach its destination.</p>
			<p class="text"> imagine azam puts a letter in the mail that is addressed to sam, 
			who lives in the town right next to him. For the letter to reach sam as quickly as possible, 
			it should be delivered right from Azam's post office to the post office in sam's town, and then to sam. If the letter is first sent to a post office hundreds of miles away, Azam's letter could take a lot longer to reach sam.
Like the postal service, networks are more efficient when messages travel as directly as possible. When a network receives data packets from another network,
 it will sort and route those packets by subnet so that the packets do not take an inefficient route to their destination.</p>
 
 <h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;"> What is IP ?</h1>
			<p class="text">In order to understand subnets, we must quickly define IP addresses. Every device that connects to the Internet is assigned a unique IP (Internet Protocol) address, enabling data sent over the Internet to reach the right device out of the billions of devices connected to the Internet. While computers read IP addresses as binary code
			(a series of 1s and 0s), IP addresses are usually written as a series of alphanumeric characters. </p>
			
			 <h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;"> Why is subnetting necessary?</h1>
			<p class="text"> As the previous example illustrates, the way IP addresses are constructed makes it relatively simple for Internet routers to find the right network to route data into. However, in a Class A network (for instance), there could be millions of connected devices, and it could take some time for the data to find the right device. This is why subnetting comes in handy: subnetting narrows down the IP address to usage within a range of devices.

Because an IP address is limited to indicating the network and the device address, IP addresses cannot be used to indicate which subnet an IP packet should go to. Routers within a network use something called a subnet mask to sort data into subnetworks.</p>
			
			<h1 style="color:DodgerBlue;"> What is a subnet mask?</h1>
			<p class="text"> A subnet mask is like an IP address, but for only internal usage within a network. Routers use subnet masks to route data packets to the right place. Subnet masks are not indicated within data packets traversing the Internet — those packets only indicate the destination IP address, which a router will match with a subnet.

Suppose sam answers Azam's letter, but he sends his reply to Azam's place of employment rather than his home. Azam's office is quite large with many different departments. To ensure employees receive their correspondence quickly, the administrative team at Azam's workplace sorts mail by department rather than by individual employee. After receiving sam's letter, they look up Azam's department and see he works in Customer Support. They send the letter to the Customer Support department instead of to Azam, and the customer support department gives it to Azam.

In this analogy, "Azam" is like an IP address and "Customer Support" is like a subnet mask. By matching Alice to his department, sam's letter was quickly sorted into the right group of potential recipients. Without this step, office administrators would have to spend time laboriously looking for the exact location of Azam's desk, which could be anywhere in the building.

For a real-world example, suppose an IP packet is addressed to the IP address 192.0.2.15. This IP address is a Class C network, so the network is identified by "192.0.2" (or to be technically precise, 192.0.2.0/24). Network routers forward the packet to a host on the network indicated by "192.0.2."

Once the packet arrives at that network, a router within the network consults its routing table. It does some binary mathematics using its subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, sees the device address "15" (the rest of the IP address indicates the network), and calculates which subnet the packet should go to. It forwards the packet to the router or switch responsible for delivering packets within that subnet, and the packet arrives at IP address 192.0.2.15</p>
